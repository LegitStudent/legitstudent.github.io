<p>Has humanity surpassed the very thing which has molded it? Halting the process of

natural selection is both wondrous and frightening. Being able to stop an act of nature is not

an easy feat. However, it would be scary and a little depressing if natural selection would

truly not be applicable to us. It would show that this may be our maximum condition despite

the many faults we have.</p>

<p>Natural selection works by letting those who are the fittest to their surroundings have

their genes passed on to the next generation. Natural selection requires three factors for it to

occur: that variation happens on a genetic level, that the traits of parents can be passed onto

their offspring, and that not the entire population of a species is guaranteed to survive.</p>

<p>It used to be that diseases and famine would kill humans unfit to live in their current

surroundings, making them unable to pass on their own genes. However, modern day

advancements in the fields of science and technology make it so that almost everyone is

guaranteed to have an offspring if they wish to, regardless of whether they are the most fit in

the group. In this case, the selection of whoever has a stake in the gene pool is not influenced

by natural factors, but rather it is now determined by the species itself.</p>

<p>Despite the close possibility of being able to eliminate the threats to our survival, we

may not know if we can stop natural selection. The future could be highly unpredictable.

Radical changes may happen in the future, and it could be a situation we are not familiar

with. We may possess appropriate responses to any threats to our existence, but we still have

a lot to know about the world.</p>

<p>Is it really important that we know how our universe began? After all, it is an event that has occurred a long time ago. Well, it is important for three important reasons. Firstly, we must know it because it is there to be known. This is a general concept in science and is a motivation to real life researchers in the field. If there is something left unknown waiting to be explored, why not explore it and try the possibility of discovering something new. Secondly, despite the creation of the universe’s distant point in the time, its effects are still felt in the present times. Background radiation left by the Big Bang, is significant enough to affect communication systems. Thirdly, we never truly know the importance of any knowledge we may possess today. Reinforced by the first point, any topic in “pure” science today may be a very important subject in future technology. </p>

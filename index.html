<small>Portfolio Entry # 1</small>

<p>The scientific method is one lesson that doesn't let go even until college. I'm not

complaining about it is a systematic way of finding the truth and cannot be forgotten. However,

the scientific method today is turning more into a guideline rather than a process through which

all scientific studies must undergo. Coming from a science high school, I had a first­hand

experience as to how rigorous the process is. When writing a scientific research paper, you has to

triple­check your data, make sure you're processing them right, and you can't always place right

hypotheses. It's worth thinking about how scientists work in the real world. It isn't a surprise that

some of them resort to falsifying or cherry­picking the results of their data. There are deadlines

to meet and quotas to fill so that they can sustain their research with the money earned from

publishing papers, not to mention their pride when they get a good finding. The scientific method

exists to stop these botched studies by allowing other scientists to confirm new findings and not

allow false ones to propagate misinformation and cause harm.</p>

<p>The cholesterol study that was discussed in class interested me so I looked more into it. It

turns out cholesterol is essential in keeping us alive and is used in the production of some of our

body's hormones. The scientist that started the idea that cholesterol is a factor in heart disease is

Ancel Keys. He argued that cholesterol and saturated fat consumption is related to heart disease

with his “Seven Countries” test. Given that Keys was the creator of the ration that nourished U.S.

soldiers in the second world war, his controversial study was supported by a handful of US

senators despite the questionable validity of the study. Keys's study which should not have made

far in the scientific community has become the basis for the standard low­fat, cholesterol­free,

“healthy” American diet. Despite the measures taken to decrease cholesterol, obesity and heart

disease are still part of the biggest problems that United States of America faces today. It turns

out that when the cholesterol was limited by the U.S. government, food manufacturers had

replaced cholesterol with sugar and processed carbs, the true causes of heart disease (along with

a sedentary lifestyle). Instead of Keys saving his fellow Americans from a future of bad diets, he

has done the opposite. </p>

<p>The scientific method isn't something we should take for granted. It's the reason the

human race has advanced so far. Although it is organized, there is still some margin for error and

we can't be sure if a new finding is completely true. However, with the method there are no

mistakes in science which can't be turned into useful accidents that can further the inquiry into

our natural world.</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<p>The Internet is currently one of the most popular ways for people to communicate with
each other. It is faster than writing snail mail, and more accessible throughout the world than
using phone networks. Services like Facebook and Viber provide a free and friendly platform for
people to take advantage of the Internet’s capabilities. The Internet will remain with us for a long
time which should make us think of its implications on our society. Privacy is an issue that
continually becomes more relevant due to the open nature of the Internet. Anything posted online
can go “viral”, or be spread out to a large audience whether the original poster intended it or not.
Furthermore, seemingly private sessions, like two-person chatting or email, aren’t as exclusive as
they really are. We have to have privacy online not because we engage in illegal activities, but
because it is a human right. Thus, we need to be able to secure whatever we do on the Internet,
and encryption fulfills this need.</p>

<p>Encryption works by getting a message, and changing it into a form such that only the
sender and the recipient could understand it. A basic form of encryption would be the use of a
cipher. An example of a cipher is a Caesar cipher which takes each letter in a message shifts it
three times to right of the letter’s position in the alphabet. “Hello world” would become “Ebiil
tloia”. The recipient would have to be aware of the cipher in order to decode the message.
Modern day encryption algorithms are more complicated and harder to solve, but function with
the same principle.</p>

<p>Nutrition is important that it actually shapes our lives as human beings. The scope of the
study of nutrition is very broad and can get very technical and complicated, but it suggests the
very simple and understandable concept of keeping a balance between how much energy from
the food we take in and how much of those we use. Since we can’t possibly avoid eating for we
need to do it to live, the study of nutrition will surely remain with us for as long as the human
race exists.</p>

<p>I have had my own share of experience in nutrition. It was last summer when I stumbled
upon an article that talks about how we tend to neglect physical activity nowadays and rarely
watch what we eat. This motivated me to research more into the topic, which lead me into
knowing more about nutrition. Firstly, I learned about the three macronutrients, protein, fat, and
carbohydrates. Then, there were formulas for calculating the total daily energy expenditure of a
person, and another one for the distribution of calories among the macronutrients. It was really
satisfying because it was so concrete and better than the vague advice given by a lot of people to
“just eat less and exercise”.</p>

<p>The actual challenge to proper nutrition is usually not the numbers or the knowledge
because the resources that teach actual nutrition are actually really easy to understand. For me,
the obstacle lay in my mind. I got my plan, and on paper the path was pretty much laid out for
me but there was still something that was stopping me from actually going for it. The plan
included a drastic change in diet that even though I know it’s healthy, is hard to accept. From
here we can see how our own image becomes really linked with what we eat. We tend to resist
changes in what we get used to, like how we go to school and the manner of our speaking. Big
changes never really yield productive results so, the best course of action anyone that tries to get
their nutrition right is to follow it little by little.</p>

<p>Even though we could simplify the lessons of proper nutrition down to eating the right
amount of nutrients and getting a good amount of physical activity, it does not become that
simple when we begin to put it into practice. Developing a proper lifestyle through a good diet
was never really a goal you can attain by just simply lying around all day and waiting for a
miracle to happen. Anything worthwhile is never going to be easy, and surely proper nutrition
would lead to a healthy body. As my mother would tell me over and over again, we only have
one body and one life so we need to make it count.</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4w9s1tB.png">

<p>Where will we be without biotechnology? The fields of science that made a big difference
in our society are often taken for granted because they have done a great job of integrating
themselves in our current lives. One of these fields is biotechnology which has been with us since
the dawn of ancient civilizations. Innovations in this field span from the early methods of
fermentation for wine, to modern day experiments with the genetics of living organisms.</p>

<p>Biotechnology is both wonderful and humbling. We still have a lot to find out about the
world with all its surprises and mysteries. An estimated majority of species here on Earth has not
been discovered yet which brings up the possibility of developing new enhancements to our
already revolutionary lifestyles.</p>

<p>We must remember that humanity was never always put in a position that favors it. The
world can be harsh, but a little creative biotechnology from us solves this problem and ensures
the survival of our species.</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1YGTDr8.png">

<p>Although a bit radical, the effect of science on our lifestyles can be shown by the power of the atom. Through years of scientific research, we have seen how much power an atom could release. In this situation, you could say knowledge is power. Depending on whoever holds it, he could develop an efficient method of electricity generation or a destructive weapon.</p>

<p>Our recent lectures in lifestyle show that while science could be the cause of some of the human lifestyle problems, such as the production of alcohol by fermentation, it could also form remedies for some of us through developments in sexually-transmitted disease research and helpful medical warnings on smoking.</p>
 
<p>Lifestyle choices really fall on us. As discussed in the first lectures, scientific research does not tell us how to use the knowledge. Knowing the fact that smoking tobacco can lead to lung cancer does not stop the millions of smokers worldwide. We can just say that we are fortunate that this information is available to us, and maybe this could cause some of us to reconsider some of what we do.</p>

<p>The scientific method is one lesson that doesn't let go even until college. I'm not

complaining about it is a systematic way of finding the truth and cannot be forgotten. However,

the scientific method today is turning more into a guideline rather than a process through which

all scientific studies must undergo. Coming from a science high school, I had a first­hand

experience as to how rigorous the process is. When writing a scientific research paper, you has to

triple­check your data, make sure you're processing them right, and you can't always place right

hypotheses. It's worth thinking about how scientists work in the real world. It isn't a surprise that

some of them resort to falsifying or cherry­picking the results of their data. There are deadlines

to meet and quotas to fill so that they can sustain their research with the money earned from

publishing papers, not to mention their pride when they get a good finding. The scientific method

exists to stop these botched studies by allowing other scientists to confirm new findings and not

allow false ones to propagate misinformation and cause harm.</p>

<p>The cholesterol study that was discussed in class interested me so I looked more into it. It

turns out cholesterol is essential in keeping us alive and is used in the production of some of our

body's hormones. The scientist that started the idea that cholesterol is a factor in heart disease is

Ancel Keys. He argued that cholesterol and saturated fat consumption is related to heart disease

with his “Seven Countries” test. Given that Keys was the creator of the ration that nourished U.S.

soldiers in the second world war, his controversial study was supported by a handful of US

senators despite the questionable validity of the study. Keys's study which should not have made

far in the scientific community has become the basis for the standard low­fat, cholesterol­free,

“healthy” American diet. Despite the measures taken to decrease cholesterol, obesity and heart

disease are still part of the biggest problems that United States of America faces today. It turns

out that when the cholesterol was limited by the U.S. government, food manufacturers had

replaced cholesterol with sugar and processed carbs, the true causes of heart disease (along with

a sedentary lifestyle). Instead of Keys saving his fellow Americans from a future of bad diets, he

has done the opposite. </p>

<p>The scientific method isn't something we should take for granted. It's the reason the

human race has advanced so far. Although it is organized, there is still some margin for error and

we can't be sure if a new finding is completely true. However, with the method there are no

mistakes in science which can't be turned into useful accidents that can further the inquiry into

our natural world.</p>

<p>Along our discussion in class about Intellectual Property Rights, we tackled the

subject of HeLa cells which are the “immortal” cervical cancer cells taken from Henrietta 

Lacks. These cells were harvested the without Lacks’ or her family’s permission and has 

caused some concern but during that time it wasn’t a legal requirement to ask for it. Despite 

this, HeLa cells are now being used in the research of some deadly diseases like cancer and AIDS.</p>

<p> One of the more known applications for HeLa cells was the polio vaccine. Polio or

poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease that is caused by the poliovirus. The virus targets 

the nervous system of its victim and paralyzes him. There is no cure for the disease but, there 

are efforts around the world to eradicate the disease.<sup>i</sup> These efforts would not have been 

possible if it weren’t for the discovery of the first polio vaccine. On the sixteenth day of 

March of the year 1953, an American researcher named Dr. Jonas Salk has announced that he 

has found a working vaccine for poliomyelitis.<sup>ii</sup> Dr. Salk’s vaccine is a blessing to humanity, 

and it has given us a chance to fight back against polio. The demand for the polio vaccine and 

filing a patent for it would have been very profitable. Fortunately, Dr. Salk’s only interest and

commitment was public health, and he did not patent his vaccine. </p>

<p> The action of Dr. Jonas Salk shows us that although patents can be tools for personal

gain, one might consider whether an invention may be better off unpatented. He might have 

had thoughts about how rich he could have gotten with the vaccine patent but it had been -

outshined by his dedication to help a cause bigger than him. </p>

<p>The Internet is currently one of the most popular ways for people to communicate with
each other. It is faster than writing snail mail, and more accessible throughout the world than
using phone networks. Services like Facebook and Viber provide a free and friendly platform for
people to take advantage of the Internet’s capabilities. The Internet will remain with us for a long
time which should make us think of its implications on our society. Privacy is an issue that
continually becomes more relevant due to the open nature of the Internet. Anything posted online
can go “viral”, or be spread out to a large audience whether the original poster intended it or not.
Furthermore, seemingly private sessions, like two-person chatting or email, aren’t as exclusive as
they really are. We have to have privacy online not because we engage in illegal activities, but
because it is a human right. Thus, we need to be able to secure whatever we do on the Internet,
and encryption fulfills this need.</p>

<p>Encryption works by getting a message, and changing it into a form such that only the
sender and the recipient could understand it. A basic form of encryption would be the use of a
cipher. An example of a cipher is a Caesar cipher which takes each letter in a message shifts it
three times to right of the letter’s position in the alphabet. “Hello world” would become “Ebiil
tloia”. The recipient would have to be aware of the cipher in order to decode the message.
Modern day encryption algorithms are more complicated and harder to solve, but function with
the same principle.</p>

<p>Nutrition is important that it actually shapes our lives as human beings. The scope of the
study of nutrition is very broad and can get very technical and complicated, but it suggests the
very simple and understandable concept of keeping a balance between how much energy from
the food we take in and how much of those we use. Since we can’t possibly avoid eating for we
need to do it to live, the study of nutrition will surely remain with us for as long as the human
race exists.</p>

<p>As much as the problems about our environment is actually really big on the outside, it is just as big in the inside. One question we could ask is if we are truly worried about the earth? Is “Mother Nature” actually in danger? The basis of our anxiety for environmental problems may be rooted in our instinct for survival. We may have gone through periods of rational thought and enlightenment, but our evolved brain is still hardwired for survival. It may be that we are not aiming to save the world, but rather we aim to save to world to save ourselves.</p>

<p>In the long run, humanity might not be that significant. The geological time scale could span billions of years, whereas our survival cannot afford that security as of this moment. Environmental problems threaten this surviva, which is where the topic of sustainable development comes in.</p>

<p>Sustainable development is simplified as “leaving enough for the next one”. We develop a kind of selflessness even if it's only among our own kind. </p>

<p>The topics of biodiversity and climate change are very vast, and can get really

complicated. They are composed of several disciplines that may not be limited to natural

sciences as fields like business and humanities play important roles in them. As each day

pass, these topics become more raised as the problems that threaten our living conditions

become more concerning. Climate change starts to be noticeable with more extreme weather,

and stronger typhoons. Species continue to disappear which causes more disappearances in

an awful chain reaction. It may seem that we are in a dark hour, and indeed we are, but efforts

from around the world help us recover from this degradation of our surroundings. “Pro­earth”

groups spring up everywhere and the theme of “sustainable development” become common

in a lot of projects. At this point in time, we don’t seem so hopeless.</p>

<p>Humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels is very alarming. Not only are we faced with a

future of completely using up a valuable earth resource, the use of these fuels make our

homes dirtier and less fit to live in. Fortunately, the solution to this problem is not a distinct

possibility anymore. Cities around the world, especially those that belong in major powers

like the United States and China, are establishing renewable energy goals. They make it a

goal to have certain percentages of their energy to be from renewable sources like solar

farms, and hydroelectric plants. The Philippines isn’t in a position to be left behind. As a

country in the Pacific Ring of Fire, it has active volcanic activity which makes geothermal

energy a viable alternative source of renewable energy.</p>

<p>Electric cars has the possibility of penetrating the automobile market. They offer a

cleaner replacement to the current fossil fuel powered vehicles we use daily. It used to be an

“ideal” solution, but innovators like Mr. Elon Musk, has made this ideal solution practical.</p>

<p>The people around the world had made a lot of mistakes in the past few centuries.

These mistakes have caused a bunch of problems for their future generations. Currently, the

outlook for our future isn’t that great, but eventually we’ll correct our past mistakes and make

the world a better place.</p>

<p>As much as the problems about our environment is actually really big on the outside, it is just as big in the inside. One question we could ask is if we are truly worried about the earth? Is “Mother Nature” actually in danger? The basis of our anxiety for environmental problems may be rooted in our instinct for survival. We may have gone through periods of rational thought and enlightenment, but our evolved brain is still hardwired for survival. It may be that we are not aiming to save the world, but rather we aim to save to world to save ourselves.</p>

<p>In the long run, humanity might not be that significant. The geological time scale could span billions of years, whereas our survival cannot afford that security as of this moment. Environmental problems threaten this survival, which is where the topic of sustainable development comes in.</p>

<p>Sustainable development is simplified as “leaving enough for the next one”. We develop a kind of selflessness even if it's only among our own kind. Here, we see that while the big picture of environmental problems can be complicated, the individual player, the interior of these conflicts, can be just as hard to discern as well. Disciplines mix as each of the arts and sciences play a role in the problems that pose a threat to our future. Nevertheless, this selfless effort is not done in vain. This effort carries with it a optimistic idea that we can be saved.</p>
